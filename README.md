## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

- Nice to try to follow a design and try to figure out how to make it work.
- Using `display: grid;` instead of `display: flex;` to make the layout work.
- Trying to use css variables to make the code more readable and easier to maintain.

### Continued development

Will try to learn more about semtantic markup and how to utilize css variables.
